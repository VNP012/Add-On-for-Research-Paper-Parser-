# Semantic Scholar Paper Enricher

A lightweight Python tool that **enriches research paper CSVs** with **DOIs and direct URLs** from the Semantic Scholar API.  
This project extends the SDSC parser workflow by adding **clickable links** to every suggested paper for faster access, citation, and analysis.

---

## ✨ Features
- Enriches plain CSVs of papers with:
  - **DOI** identifiers  
  - **Direct Semantic Scholar URLs**  
  - **Verified Year & Venue metadata**  
- Works with CSVs generated by the [Semantic Scholar Parser Project](https://github.com/your-link-here) or any CSV containing paper titles.  
- Saves enriched files in `.csv` format for easy viewing in Excel, Numbers, or Pandas.  
- Respects Semantic Scholar API limits (**1 request/second**).

## 📂 Repository Contents
- **`enrich_papers.py`** – Main enrichment script.  
- **`sample_workflow.md`** – Step-by-step usage guide for enrichment.  
- **`requirements.txt`** – Python dependencies for reproducibility.  
- **README.md** – Project documentation.  

> ⚠️ Only the above files are **critical for running the project**.  
Other files (e.g. outputs, logs, temporary CSVs) are supplementary artifacts.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/semantic-scholar-paper-enricher.git
cd semantic-scholar-paper-enricher

 - Install Dependencies

Recommended inside a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows PowerShell

pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt

 - API Key
	•	Request an API key from Semantic Scholar.
	•	Add it to enrich_papers.py:
API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"

 - Usage
Enrich a single file
python enrich_papers.py

Enter path to your CSV when prompted, e.g.:
Enter path to input CSV: /Users/username/Downloads/results_materials_science.csv

This creates:
enriched_results_materials_science.csv

 - Example Output
Input (results_materials_science.csv):
Title,Year,Venue
Photothermal Nanomaterials,2023,Chemical Reviews

 - Output (enriched_results_materials_science.csv):
Title,Year,Venue,DOI,URL
Photothermal Nanomaterials,2023,Chemical Reviews,10.1038/nmat1234,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/abcd

 - Sample Workflow
See sample_workflow.md for a full walkthrough, including:
	•	Enriching one file.
	•	Running enrichment on multiple CSVs.
	•	Using the enriched files locally (Excel, Numbers, Pandas).

 - Requirements
	•	Python 3.8+
	•	requests >= 2.25.0
	•	pandas >= 1.3.0
Install with:
pip install -r requirements.txt

 - Notes
	•	This workflow is a reference implementation; commands may vary depending on your environment.
	•	The Semantic Scholar API currently allows 1 request/second – expect a few minutes for large batches.
	•	For parallel or HPC enrichment, integration with SLURM or job arrays is possible (see parent project).

 - Use Cases
	•	Build research dashboards with clickable citations.
	•	Quickly access papers from large keyword searches.
	•	Prepare datasets for meta-analysis or bibliographic tools.
